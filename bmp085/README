This sub20 app bmp085 is used to interact via i2c with the temperature and pressure
sensor by bosh.
DS is available here: https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/General/BST-BMP085-DS000-05.pdf
I've ordered from here:

## Connections and Conf.
Sub20 has been configured to operate GPIO at 5v Jumper J7 to the left.
bmp085 is powerd by using gpio-34 GND and gpio-33 Vcc
for the i2c part :
 SDA to gpio-1
 SCL to gpio-2

Slave Address 0x77

# example for reading a register using the sub_app
sub_app -i=0x77,1,0xD0,2
the above command read i2c slave 0x77 addressing register at 1 byte at time , read register 0xD0 ,for 2 byte , so it reads 0xd0 and 0xd1
